                    <div class="w3-container">
                        <p>For some reason, it took me a really long time to finally give in and play Hades.</p>
                        <p>Everyone was talking about how amazing it was, from the fluid action to the rich character
                            stories. But I kept telling myself it wasn't for me.</p>
                        <p>I was wrong, of course. It's totally for me.</p>
                        <p></p>Hades is an incredible blend of fast, hack n' slash action with an overall roguelite
                        structure centered on repeated attempts to escape the underworld.</p>

                        <p>As Zagrius, the player starts with a handful of weapon options and a few support abilities.
                            Making your way through the various stages of the underworld, a player fleshes out their
                            build with a huge range of powers granted by the various gods. Play your cards right - and
                            get a little lucky - and you can build up an incredible set of abilities that reinforce each
                            other, turning you into a whirlwind of death and destruction in a multitude of ways.</p>

                        <p>By itself, that would be pretty fun.</p>

                        <p>Hades takes it a step further, adding a heaping pile of metaprogression on top of things.
                            Each run earns you more resources to spend at the start of your next run, opening up new
                            innate abilities, weapon powers, and all sorts of other things. Naturally, runs start to get
                            easier, but players can even choose to handicap themselves for greater rewards.</p>

                        <p>Again, this is already a fantastic framework. But Hades takes it even further, doing
                            something not a lot of roguelites do - it adds a ton of story to progress through as well.
                        </p>

                        <p>While the overarching story of Zagrius's escape has its own progression to work through
                            (requiring multiple victories), all of his friends, foes, and family members have their own
                            individual storylines a player can slowly develop across the span of many runs. So even if
                            someone feels like they've finished the "main" part of the game, there's almost always more
                            to come back and keep playing for.</p>

                        <p>Maybe, like me, you looked at Hades at first and thought it wasn't going to be the kind of
                            gameplay for you. You might be right, but I'd still urge you to give it a try. Even if you
                            stumble your way through, you will probably find something about you love.</p>

                        <p>That's why Hades is the best roguelite.</p>
