          <div class="w3-container">
            <p>There's an inevitability that as you give a player more and more options, you start to expontentially
              increase the number of potential cominbations they can make from them.</p>

            <p>That's just math.</p>

            <p>If I give you four choices and say "pick two", there's only six possible sets you can choose. Not too
              bad, all things considered.</p>

            <p>But if I double your options from four to eight, it doesn't just double the outcomes. Now there are
              twenty-eight possible combinations. Even if we leave the set of eight options the same but let the player
              pick three instead of two, well now we've got fifty-six outcomes.</p>

            <p>I could keep doing math all day, but we're here to talk about roguelites.</p>

            <p style="text-align:center"><img src="../images/math-wizard.jpg" alt="The Math Wizard" style="width:60%; margin:auto;"></p>
            <p style="color:#666; text-align:center;">Math: How Does It Work?</p>

            <p>By the very nature of having a metaprogression, roguelites are almost always introducing new options to
              players. Whether it's new cards in Spire, new perks in <em>Against the Storm</em>, or new jokers in <em>Balatro</em>, the
              steady stream of choices is part of what keeps players doing run after run.</p>

            <p>Even within runs themselves, because of randomization, players could see an endless number of different
              choices along the way.</p>

            <p>Again, this can be very compelling to the player. As a designer, however, it's an absolute nightmare.</p>

            <p>Take <em>Balatro</em> as a quick example. There are somewhere in the neighborhood of 150 jokers a player could
              potentially find. During the course of their run they will see some percentage of those as options, and a
              smaller subset of that to actually hold on. At any given time they could 0-5 jokers on their board, with
              the potential to add even more depending on what sort of bonuses they find along the way.</p>

            <p>So given that, even at the most basic level of saying a set of 5 out of 150, that's 591,600,030 potential
              combinations of jokers.</p>

            <p>Balancing for all of those outcomes is impossible. So what do you do?</p>

            <p>Ben McGraw, producer of <em>Dungeon of Dredmor</em> (a more traditional rogue<strong>like</strong>, and very fun) says the answer is
              easy: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaQGNjqxKto&list=PLi7jNGNQhwdhiZcp2g4yU7xpXmOqS9VBl&index=3" target="_blank">embrace the chaos.</a></p>
              <img src="../images/dredmor.jpg" alt="Dungeons of Dredmor" style="width:100%">
                        <p style="color:#666; text-align:center;">Not a roguelite, but it can be forgiven</p>

            <p>Sure, you could minimize the impact of what the jokers do, or cap bonuses to keep things in a tight
              range, but where's the fun in that? This isn't some AAA multiplayer affair where everything has to be
              precisely balanced to keep everybody happy. No, these are roguelites - sometimes the most fun to be had is
              when they get very, very broken.</p>

            <p>If you play roguelites, I'll bet the stories you share most about them involve times you felt like you
              were breaking the game. Spire decks where you were playing twenty or more cards a turn, or <em>Noita</em>*** dives
              where you put together wands that nuked half the map. When designers allow for things to just get *wacky*,
              that's often when games shine the most.</p>

            <p>With the right combination, players might feel like they've broken the rules of the game entirely. And so
              what if it lets them absolutely crush a run? There are no other players pissed off by "imbalance", and now
              they've got a great story to tell. And, a lot of the time, they might never see that particular
              combination of elements again.</p>

            <p>Embracing the broken is part of what can make roguelites some crazy, crazy fun.</p>

            <p>And that's why roguelites are the best.</p>
            <p><span style="color:#666">***<em>Noita</em> is a tricky one, as it has the scantest of meta-progressions. It's certainly in the roguelite spirit, though.</span></p>
